Right now I have a good plan on things to do. Pivit design for large data set quick random access.

The data frame will automatically write to binary uniform files while initially parsing files.
    These files can either persist or be deleted after program end.
    For random access, all rows must be the same size. This means that strings will have a uniform size.

data frame will allow for long indexs.
    Need to get rid of the operators, as they only accet int. Maybenot actually....

in constructor, the user can specifiy max in memory data usage.
    Per row data usage will be calculated on data frame startup.

The files will be in binary for easy reading.

I will need to add types for all other values. I may need to drastically improve code quality -
    And simplicity to do this, as it will take a while.
